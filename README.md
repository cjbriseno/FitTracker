## Background and motivation
As college students who are passionate about fitness and nutrition, we've noticed the challenge of staying healthy in our busy lives. That's why we're developing a simple Swift app to help people easily find and track the nutritional content of their food.

Our motivation is to create a user-friendly tool that makes it effortless for individuals to make informed choices about what they eat. We want to simplify the process of discovering and logging food items, so people can better understand and improve their dietary habits.

Our app connects users to a database of food items through an API, making it quick and accurate to log meals. The focus is on a food diary feature that helps users build awareness of their eating patterns over time.

To keep things motivating, we're including a visual daily calorie tracker in the form of a simple circle. This feature not only shows users their daily caloric intake but also represents their progress toward health and fitness goals.

As fitness enthusiasts and tech lovers, we're excited to help our college community and beyond adopt a healthier lifestyle. Our app aims to make it easy for users to take control of their health journey by providing accessible and engaging tools for better nutrition choices. Together, let's embrace the connection between technology and well-being for a happier, healthier life.

### Summary
Our Swift app simplifies the pursuit of a healthier lifestyle by allowing users to effortlessly search and log food items, utilizing an API for accuracy. With a user-friendly interface, our focus is on a visual daily calorie tracker, displayed as a simple circle, providing at-a-glance insights into nutritional progress. As college students passionate about fitness and nutrition, we aim to empower individuals to make informed choices, fostering a community that values the seamless integration of technology and well-being.
